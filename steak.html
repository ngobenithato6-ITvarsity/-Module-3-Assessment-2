                    <p>My youngest son is such a steak and potatoes guy. He won’t eat anything else but I can count on him to eat a good steak. He actually was in the kitchen with me helping me make this recipe. He loves to cook with me. He even told me to make sure to “sear the steak”, and to give the potatoes a slightly “charred” edge. With his help, we were able to create one of the best steaks that you will ever eat!

You start by cooking the potatoes in a delicious garlic herb butter. It really brings amazing flavor to these potatoes. Garlic herb butter potatoes? My heaven.</p>
